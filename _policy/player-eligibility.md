# FIT Player Eligibility Policy

## Introduction

1.  Player eligibility for international sporting competition can be a complex and often emotive
    issue. The defining elements are at the very heart of global competition and key issues involved
    in ascertaining eligibility include aspects of nationality, passport, residency, place of birth,
    playing history, the respective country's selection process and even a player's gender, birth
    date and age.
2.  A player's eligibility to represent a country requires some form of direct link between the
    individual and the represented country. The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)
    has ruled that Legal Nationality and Sporting Nationality may be "different", one defined in
    Public Law and the other in Private Law.
3.  The Federation of International Touch therefore has the authority to decide eligibility criteria
    for participants in the sport in the international arena as governed by the Federation and
    Members. Specific eligibility criteria may differ from Legal Nationality and should be subject
    to any internationally endorsed anti discrimination or equality policies. The focus of this
    Eligibility Policy is that the criteria are both fair and equitable to most.
4.  The Federation also agrees that the basis of International Sport should be just that, about
    individuals competing for their country against individuals from another country and any
    competing national team should be a representative national team organized by the national
    governing body of the relevant Member.

## Application

1.  This policy applies to all Federation Events as defined below.
2.  This policy applies to all players competing at any Federation Event. Members are responsible
    for ensuring all individuals representing that Member meet the eligibility criteria prior to
    participating at a Federation Event.
3.  Members are encouraged to apply this policy to all events that are not afforded Federation Event
    status.
4.  This policy does not apply to officials, coaches, referees, or support staff.

## Definitions

Continuous Resident
:   An individual who has maintained their domicile in one Country or territory except for short
    periods of absence away from the normal place of residence for holidays, business travel or
    similar short trips. When defining the permitted length of a period of absence, the guideline of
    "a few weeks but no longer than a few months" is to apply.

Country
:   A geographic region as defined by the 2008 FIT Constitution.

Driving License
:   A current, photographic, identification card issued by a government department entitling an
    individual to drive in a specific country or region.

Federation
:   The Federation of International Touch

Federation Event
:   A Touch tournament at which Tier 1, 2 or 3 competition occurs in accordance with event
    classification contained in the Federation Event Classification Policy.

International Season
:   The period from April 1 to July 31 each calendar year during which period Federation Events may
    be scheduled.

Legal National
:   An individual player who has been formally and permanently recognised by the respective
    government as a person of origin of a Country, on the basis of any legal criteria pertaining to
    that Country, whereby the individual's status is not dependent on residence within that Country.

Member
:   National Touch Associations affiliated with the Federation and they may be Full Members,
    Associate Members or Federation Members as defined from time to time.

Naturalised Citizen
:   An individual player who has completed any required process set out by the government of a
    Country to obtain rights equivalent to becoming a Legal National, including the requirement
    where the individual's naturalized status is not dependent on residence within the relevant
    Country.

Parent
:   Either a biological (blood) parent or a legal guardian (adopted) of an individual. For the
    purpose of this policy a step parent or foster parent is not considered a parent unless they are
    the legal guardian of the player in question.

Passport
:   An official document issued by a government department certifying the status of an individual in
    respect of a Country and used by an individual for international travel.

Place of Birth
:   The location of birth as recorded on an individual's birth certificate (being the formal,
    statutory document recording the place, date and time of birth of an individual). For the
    purposes of this policy a certified copy of a birth certificate or "birth extract" is deemed to
    be sufficient.

Represented
:   An individual listed on the player registration sheet for a Member participating in a Federation
    Event is deemed to have represented that Member. "Represent", "Representing" and
    "Representation" shall be interpreted accordingly.

## Eligibility Criteria

1.  For an individual to be eligible to Represent a Member country in Federation Event, the
    individual must be able to prove that:
    1.  They are a Legal National or Naturalised Citizen of the Country of the relevant Member; or
    2.  They have a Parent whose Place of Birth was:
        1.  in the Country, in the event that the Member is the only Member within the Country (e.g.
            South Africa); or
        2.  in the territory for which the Member is recognized by the Federation, in the event that
            the Country contains multiple Members (e.g. the United Kingdom); or
    3.  They have been a Continuous Resident of:
        1.  the Country, in the event that the Member is the only Member within the Country (e.g.
            South Africa); or
        2.  the territory for which the Member is recognized by the Federation, in the event that
            the Country contains multiple Members (e.g. the United Kingdom)
        for the three years preceding the relevant Federation Event.

    Normally, individuals must satisfy only one of the above requirements. However, where satisfying
    paragraph 4.1.1 results in an individual being able to Represent multiple Members at the same
    time, the individual must additionally satisfy:
    -   their Place of Birth is in the territory for which the Member is recognized by the
        Federation (e.g. Ireland); or
    -   4.1.2; or
    -   4.1.3

    before their first Representation for that Member, after which time this additional requirement
    is not necessary.
2.  In addition to the above requirement at paragraph 4.1, to be eligible to Represent a Member in a
    Federation Event an individual must not have Represented another Member in a Federation Event
    during the previous three (3) International Seasons (which includes the periods of time between
    such international seasons). For the avoidance of doubt, clause 4.2 shall never prevent an
    individual Representing a Member where an individual intends to Represent a Member in a Tier 1
    event and where the individual's last Representation was the previous running of the same Tier 1
    event. This requirement is subject to the exception in paragraph 5.2.2.
3.  In addition to the criteria listed in paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 above, to be eligible to
    participate in Federation events, an individual must also meet:
    1.  Membership and eligibility requirements of the Member including, but not limited to, matters
        relating to registration, insurance and financial status; and
    2.  Gender criteria (male / men's or female / women's); and
    3.  Age criteria in relevant divisions. It is normal for "Senior" divisions to specify a minimum
        age by the year of competition or a minimum year of birth. It is normal for "Youth"
        divisions to specify a maximum age by the year of competition or a maximum year of birth.
        Tournament regulations will specify the criteria; and
    4.  Solely in the event that the individual has previously Represented another Member and relies
        upon clauses 4.1.2 or 4.1.3 to satisfy the requirements of clause 4.1, the following
        additional requirements must have been met during both of the (2) years immediately
        preceding the date of the individual's application for eligibility in respect of the new
        Member:
        1.  The individual must have competed in the national Touch championships (or equivalent
            pinnacle representative event) of the Member they intend to Represent; and
        2.  The individual must have been a registered and financial member of an affiliated Touch
            club within the Member they intend to Represent.
    5.  The requirements of clause 4.3.4 may be waived by the Federation, upon application by an
        individual, in the event that the individual's failure to satisfy the requirements were
        outside of the individual's control including, but not limited to, situations such as injury
        or cancellation of events.
4.  An individual participating in any Federation Event must be able to clearly prove their identity
    by having available to present one of the following as required:
    1.  Current Driving License; or
    2.  Current Passport; or
    3.  Other, suitable photographic evidence.
5.  The responsibility to prove eligibility rests with both the individual and with the Member.
    Players whose eligibility may be perceived as questionable for a particular Federation Event
    should ensure that adequate and appropriate justification is at hand.

## Multiple Representations

1.  An individual who has Represented a Member in a Federation Event may seek a clearance to
    represent a different Member country provided that individual meets the eligibility criteria
    listed in paragraph 4.1 to 4.3 above, for the different Member.
2.  An individual is entitled to multiple changes provided that the following provisions are adhered
    to:
    1.  For an individual aged 18 years or older at the time of their most recent previous
        representation to be granted their first and/or second change of Representation, they must
        satisfy clauses:
        -   4.1; and
        -   4.2; and
        -   all elements of paragraph 4.3
    2.	For an individual aged under 18 years at the time of their most recent previous

        -   Satisfy the Federation (exercising its sole discretion) that the change in
            Representation is required due to an extraordinary set of circumstances resulting in the
            change of Representation being in the best interests of the sport of Touch and which
            maintains the integrity of fair sporting competition and the reputation of the
            Federation and the sport of Touch.
3.  Consideration of the circumstances of any request for a change should be applied and may include

        Federation Event.
    2.  The Federation Secretary General will then seek written comment from the national governing
        body of the individual's current Member followed by the national governing body of the
        individual's intended new Member.
    3.  Following consideration of the matter the Federation Secretary General will advise the
        individual and the national governing bodies of both relevant Members of the decision in
